Zac and Sienna met her senior year of high school. 
They didn’t know each other until her best friend’s 18th birthday, 
where they were placed as dance partners together. 
After that, they noticed each other at all the choir events and in the halls of Monache. 
From having sushi as their first date to FaceTiming every night, 
they truly became each other’s best friend. Since then, they’ve been through thick and thin. 
They experienced college together, attending CSUB. 
They supported one another throughout their college journeys, 
and are grateful to now work in the same profession. 
They thank God everyday for the life He has blessed them with.
